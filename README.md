# Virtual Assistant System

## Overview

This project is a **Virtual Assistant System** built using **React.js** and integrates the **Google Studio API** for managing and visualizing data. It also utilizes the **Gemini-1.5 Flash** model, an advanced Large Language Model (LLM), to provide intelligent and context-aware assistance.

The system leverages the flexibility of **React Components** and **Hooks** for efficient state management and UI rendering, creating a responsive and interactive user experience. Styling is done with **Bootstrap** to ensure a consistent and modern look across all devices.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Assistance:** Powered by the **Gemini-1.5 Flash** LLM, the virtual assistant delivers accurate and contextual responses, improving user interactions.
  
- **React Components & Hooks:** Utilizes React's modern features to build reusable components and manage state seamlessly, ensuring a smooth and modular development process.

- **Google Studio API Integration:** Retrieves and visualizes data from Google Studio, providing users with real-time insights and interactive dashboards.

- **Responsive User Interface with Bootstrap:** Built with a focus on UX/UI, the assistant adapts to various screen sizes and devices, ensuring an intuitive experience using **Bootstrap** for styling.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js
